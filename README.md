<br> Lasso, Causal forest, Bayesian causal forest codes are created based on from their vignette
<br> Meta-learner R codes are shown based on codes in: Salditt M, et al. A Tutorial Introduction to Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation with Meta-learners.(Adm Policy Ment Health. doi:10.1007/s10488-023-01303-9). Please read the original paper for further information.

The codes have the following steps
<br> ###Step 1: Install packages
<br> ###Step 2: Set parameters and data generation
<br> ###Step 3: Creating datasets
<br> ###Step 4: Run analysis (Lasso, Causal forest, Bayesian Causal forest)
<br> ###Step 5: Run analysis (Meta-learner)
<br> ###Step 6: Evaluation of the model performance (example code for calibration)
